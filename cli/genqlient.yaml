  # To bind a scalar:
  Time:
    # The fully-qualified name of the Go type to which to bind.  For example:
    #  time.Time
    #  map[string]interface{}
    #  github.com/you/yourpkg/subpkg.MyType
    # Specifically, this can be any of the following expressions:
    # - any named type (qualified by the full package path)
    # - any predeclared basic type (string, int, etc.)
    # - interface{}
    # - for any allowed type T, *T, []T, [N]T, and map[string]T
    # but can't be, for example:
    # - an inline (unnamed) struct or interface type
    # - a map whose key-type is not string
    # - a nonstandard way of spelling those, (interface {/* hi */},
    #   map[  string      ]T)
